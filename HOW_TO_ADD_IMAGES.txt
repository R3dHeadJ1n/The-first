HOW TO ADD YOUR LOGO AND BACKGROUND IMAGE
==========================================

STEP 1: PREPARE YOUR IMAGES
---------------------------
1. Make sure your logo and background images are saved on your computer
2. Good formats: .png, .jpg, .jpeg, .svg
3. For logo: Recommended size is around 150-200 pixels wide
4. For background: Can be any size, but larger is better (1920x1080 or bigger)

STEP 2: COPY YOUR IMAGES TO THE PROJECT FOLDER
-----------------------------------------------
1. Open File Explorer
2. Go to: C:\Users\user\projects\The-first
3. Copy your logo file and paste it into this folder
4. Copy your background image and paste it into this folder

STEP 3: RENAME YOUR FILES (IMPORTANT!)
---------------------------------------
Your logo file MUST be named exactly: "logo.png"
   - If your logo is a .jpg file, rename it to "logo.jpg"
   - If your logo is a .png file, rename it to "logo.png"

Your background file can be named anything, but we'll use: "background.jpg"
   - Or "background.png" if it's a PNG file

STEP 4: UPDATE THE CODE
-----------------------
For LOGO:
- Open index.html in a text editor (like Notepad or Cursor)
- Find this line: <img src="logo.png" alt="Restaurant & Hotel Logo"
- Change "logo.png" to match your actual filename (e.g., "logo.jpg" if your file is logo.jpg)

For BACKGROUND IMAGE:
- Open style.css in a text editor
- Find this line: /* background-image: url('background.jpg'); */
- Remove the /* and */ symbols to uncomment it
- Change "background.jpg" to match your actual filename

STEP 5: SAVE AND REFRESH
-------------------------
1. Save both files (index.html and style.css)
2. Open index.html in your browser
3. Press F5 or Ctrl+R to refresh if you already had it open

TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------
- If logo doesn't show: Check that the filename matches exactly (including .png or .jpg)
- If background doesn't show: Make sure you removed the /* and */ symbols in CSS
- If images are too big/small: We can adjust the size in the CSS file
