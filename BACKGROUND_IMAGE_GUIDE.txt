BACKGROUND IMAGE SIZE GUIDE
============================

RECOMMENDED SIZES FOR BACKGROUND IMAGE:
---------------------------------------

OPTION 1 - Standard Desktop (Best Quality):
   Width: 1920 pixels
   Height: 1080 pixels
   This is the most common size and will look great on most screens.

OPTION 2 - High Resolution (For Retina/4K Screens):
   Width: 3840 pixels
   Height: 2160 pixels
   This is for very high-quality displays, but file size will be larger.

OPTION 3 - Minimum Size (Still Works):
   Width: 1280 pixels
   Height: 720 pixels
   Smaller file size, but might look slightly pixelated on large screens.

RECOMMENDED ASPECT RATIO:
-------------------------
16:9 ratio (width:height)
This matches most computer screens and will look best.

FILE FORMATS:
-------------
- .jpg or .jpeg (best for photos, smaller file size)
- .png (best if you need transparency, but larger file size)

FILE SIZE TIPS:
---------------
- Try to keep the file under 2MB for faster loading
- If your image is too large, you can compress it using online tools
- Good quality images between 500KB - 1.5MB work great

WHAT KIND OF IMAGE WORKS BEST:
------------------------------
- Subtle, not too busy (so text and buttons remain readable)
- Light or medium brightness (dark images make text hard to read)
- Related to restaurant/hotel theme:
  * Cozy dining area
  * Hotel lobby or room
  * Food presentation
  * Warm, welcoming atmosphere
- Avoid very bright or very dark images

HOW TO ADD YOUR BACKGROUND:
---------------------------
1. Save your image in the project folder: C:\Users\user\projects\The-first
2. Name it: background.jpg (or background.png)
3. Open style.css file
4. Find line 10 (the background gradient line)
5. Add this line right after line 10:
   background-image: url('background.jpg');
6. Save the file
7. Refresh your browser

The background will appear behind everything, and the gradient will be removed.
